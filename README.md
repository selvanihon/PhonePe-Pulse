# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration:
A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly
Technologies : Github Cloning, Python, Pandas, MySQL,
mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.
 Domain : Fintech
 Problem Statement:
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to
various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
The solution must include the following steps:
1. Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and
clone it..
2. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning
and pre-processing steps.
3. Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and
retrieval.
4. Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python
to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
5. Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
6. Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different
facts and figures to display on the dashboard.
The solution must be secure, efficient, and user-friendly. The dashboard must be
easily accessible and provide valuable insights and information about the data in the
Phonepe pulse Github repository.

# The learning outcomes of this project:
1. Data extraction and processing: You will learn how to use Clone Github to
extract data from a repository and pre-process the data using Python libraries
such as Pandas.
2. Database management: You will learn how to use a relational database such
as MySQL to store data and retrieve it efficiently for analysis and visualization.
3. Visualization and dashboard creation: You will learn how to use libraries
such as Streamlit and Plotly to create interactive and visually appealing
dashboards for data visualization.
4. Geo visualization: You will learn how to create and display data on a map
using Plotly's built-in geo map functions.
5. Dynamic updating: You will learn how to create a dashboard that
dynamically updates based on the latest data in a database.
6. Project development and deployment: You will learn how to develop a
comprehensive and user-friendly solution, from data extraction to dashboard
deployment. You will also learn how to test and deploy the solution to ensure it
is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
